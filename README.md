# Bachelor Project Helene Hinskens

For my Bachelor Projects I was interested in finding selectivity in a data donation. 
This specific data donation took place in 2020 after an intenstive study period of 7 months where 388 students from the ages 12-15 were asessed.
Some students did complete the data donation of their Instagram archives and some students did not. 
For this research I used the variables measured by Project Awesome to investigate whether selectivity occured when it came to data donation 
since this selectivity could influence the study results of Project Awesome. For more information on Project Awesome, please visit: https://www.project-awesome.nl/ 

This Git contains the code and the data that was used to create my Bachelor Project. 
1. In supplementary materials you will find all of the code that was used to create my Bachelor Projects. The code was written in R 1.4.1103.
  First, you will see an overview of the packages used. Then the code for to create a logistic regression for each Research Question.
  You will find a step model to be able to identify the relevant predictors for our model. Then you will see a logistic model with the final variables
  and finally you will find the code that was used to handle the assumptions that have to be handled before performing a logistic regression. 
  
2. In the data Bachelor Project, you will find the data that we used to perform the logistic regression. 
   This csv dataset is a subset from the much larger dataset provided by Project Awesome. This dataset only contains the variables that we are interested in investigating.
